Garmin Connect IQ Game MasterMind

It's Mastermind!  Play anywhere, on the go!  And best of all, it's completely free!

Mastermind is a logic game where you try to guess the color and order of pegs.  After each guess, you get feedback to guide your next guess, but you only have so many tries to get it right!

Setting up the game:
When you start a new game, you can choose the number of pegs, colors, and guesses, and whether the peg colors are allowed to be duplicated.  These counts are controlled by + and - buttons on the screen, and the duplicate colors option is the button with three pegs.  If it shows duplicate colors, then the solution can have duplicates.  The standard game is 4 pegs, 6 colors, 9 tries, no duplicates, but you can choose from 3 to 6 pegs, 8 to 12 tries, and 6 to 8 colors!

Playing the game:
Once you tap Start, you'll be ready to play!  You start on the bottom row, which will show one peg hole highlighted in yellow.  Tap a color on the right of the screen to set that color peg in the hole and move to the next one.  You can also tap any peg to select it to receive the next color you tap.  You can tap Clear to clear your guess, or tap Guess to submit it.

Scoring your guess:
The smaller pegs to the right of each guess indicate how well you did.  A black peg means one of your pegs is exactly right.  A White peg means one of your pegs is the right color but in the wrong position.  For example, if you have one black and 2 white pegs, that means three of your pegs are the right color, and one of those three is in the right position, with the rest of your pegs the wrong color.

Statistics:
Once you finish a game, you'll have the option of viewing the statistics.  The game keeps track of how many tries it takes to win each game, and how many games you lose, and the statistics screen shows those results.

I made this game for fun and share it freely.  Find my other Garmin apps, or leave me a tip, at this link:
