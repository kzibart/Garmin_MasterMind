It's Hangman!  Play anywhere, on the go!  And best of all, it's completely free!

Instructions:
Tap New to start a new game (ends any current game).
Tap a letter to try it (single tap option), or to select it, tapping Try to try it (confirm letter option).
Try to solve the puzzle before the entire stick figure gets filled in.
Tap the top of the screen to view your game statistics at any time.
Press the menu button to change settings.

Settings:
Keyboard: Change between Single Tap or Confirm Letter
Theme: Change between outlines, solid shapes, or 3D with shadows.

There are over 2,400 puzzles built into the game.  No connectivity is required to play.

I know the keyboard keys are small, which makes it difficult to play on smaller screens.  The Confirm Letter keyboard option should help, but I'm open to suggestions on how to make letter entry easier!

I made this game for fun and share it freely.  Find my other Garmin apps, or leave me a tip, at this link:
